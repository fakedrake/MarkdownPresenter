## Phase 1: Initial idea development

!

## Product idea

A portal to aggregate the online information streams for easier
and centralized access.

- News feeds
- Social media

!

## Phase2: Need and demand analysis

!

!

## Hackers

- API to use in clients
- Strange browsers (optional responsive design)
- Privacy concerns
- Support for custom information retrieval

!

## Designers

Easy and quick access to visual data (videos/pictures/etc)

!

## Developers

Well...

!

## Usage test (Nilsen)

Rank the following with a
[google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_O6sftiS5e0Uqw9drIT_oF5vpLZYhkKHwQ48qY4NxMA/viewform).

- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency
- Error prevention
- Recognizable objects
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Help and documentation

!

## More specific testing

- Browser plugin to track (anonymously)
  - Common tasks
  - number of open tabs
  - Time spent changing context among tabs

- Specific questionnaire:
  - Under what circumstances would one give up their account

!

## Tools

UX tools are *intolerable*

!

## What I tried

- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) (that I ended up using)
- [prototyper](http://www.justinmind.com/prototyper/download)
- [axure](http://www.axure.com/)
- [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/) (for testing only)
- [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)

!

## Problems

- Not open source
- Not for linux
- Vastly overpriced
- Crappy design *(ironically)*
- Few features (they actually charge extra for pdf exports)
- Not even close to a standarized format

!

# Solution

!

## Inkscape plugin

- Open source
- Cross platform
- Most functionality is already there
- Once you have svg you can do anything
- Also SVG is an existing standard
- Every designer knows how to use that or something similar
- Already a comunity to support the core

!

## But I am probably missing something...

!

## TODO

- Filter functionality
- Rating functionality
- Proper product flow from mockups to design
- Actual design
- (obviously) Implementation

!
